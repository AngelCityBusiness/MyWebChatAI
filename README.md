The MyWebChatAI Repository holds files for creating a wrapper URL code (Integration Code) for their webchat AI bot application.
It also houses the custom domain www.mywebchatai.com, where I use as a proxy website to show businesses what the webchat bot could look like for their business.

The reason I created this was so that I could give my clients an Integration Code branded with my business in addition to showing them what a webchat ai bot would look like on their website.

Example of Integration Code:
<script src="https://www.mywebchatai.com/bot-17772.js"></script>

Which was changed from Aminos.ai's code of:
<script src="https://app.aminos.ai/js/chat_plugin.js" data-bot-id="10830"></script>
